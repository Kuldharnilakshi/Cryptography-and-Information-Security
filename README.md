Classification of Algorithms
1️⃣ Classical (Traditional) Ciphers

Classical ciphers are early cryptographic techniques that operate on letters and symbols using substitution or transposition methods.
They are not secure by modern standards, but are important for learning cryptography basics.

Algorithms included:

Caesar Cipher

Affine Cipher

Atbash Cipher

Monoalphabetic Cipher

Keyword Cipher

Playfair Cipher

Vigenère Cipher

Hill Cipher

📂 Folder: Classical-Ciphers/

2️⃣ Symmetric Key Encryption Algorithms

Symmetric encryption uses the same secret key for both encryption and decryption.
These algorithms are fast and efficient and are widely used in real-world systems.

Algorithms included:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

DES (Data Encryption Standard)

📂 Folder: Symmetric-Encryption/

3️⃣ Asymmetric Key Encryption Algorithms

Asymmetric encryption uses two keys:

Public Key → for encryption

Private Key → for decryption

It solves the secure key distribution problem.

Algorithms included:

RSA Algorithm

📂 Folder: Asymmetric-Encryption/

4️⃣ Cryptographic Hash Functions

Hash functions convert data into a fixed-length hash value.
They are one-way functions, meaning decryption is not possible.

Used mainly for:

Password storage

Data integrity

Digital signatures

Algorithms included:

MD5

📂 Folder: Hash-Functions/

5️⃣ Key Exchange Algorithms

Key exchange algorithms allow two users to securely share a secret key over an insecure network.

Algorithms included:

Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange

📂 Folder: Key-Exchange/
